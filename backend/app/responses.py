üéôÔ∏è The Joe Rogan Experience #2999: Donald Duck
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS ‚Äì same thumping bass intro]

Joe Rogan:
What's up freak bitches. My guest today is someone I‚Äôve been wanting to talk to for a long time‚Ä¶ cultural icon, war veteran, possible MK Ultra experiment... the one and only ‚Äî Donald freaking Duck.

Donald, what‚Äôs up man?
Donald Duck:
(incoherent angry quacking)

Joe (laughing):
Dude I love it. I can't understand a goddamn word you're saying but it‚Äôs powerful. You‚Äôve got presence. There‚Äôs something primal about it.

Joe:
So listen, you fought in World War II, right?

Donald Duck:
(squawking proudly, pulls out a crumpled propaganda poster of himself in uniform)

Joe:
This is wild. People don‚Äôt talk about this ‚Äî but Disney actually weaponized their characters during wartime. You were in Der Fuehrer‚Äôs Face. That shit was full-blown psychological warfare.

Donald Duck:
(nods furiously, pulls out flask labeled "Acme Ether")

Joe:
I gotta ask‚Ä¶ were you on something during that era? Some of that early government LSD? Be honest, Don.

Donald Duck:
(furious muffled rant)
[subtitles: ‚ÄúWAS I? THEY FED ME DUCKSPEED FOR FOUR YEARS!‚Äù]

Joe:
laughs hysterically DUCKSPEED. Bro that‚Äôs better than Alpha Brain.
